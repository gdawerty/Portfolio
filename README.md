# Welcome!

Hello there, and welcome to my portfolio repository. For those interested, my name is Aaron Luu. I’m currently studying computer science at Georgia Tech, specializing in AI and InfoNetwork threads. I have a strong interest in building things, especially when it comes to software and web development. Over the years, I’ve gained a lot of experience with Java, Python, Django, Git, and GitHub, along with a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms.

I’m also involved in a research group that focuses on multi-robot interaction, where we use ROS and Python to develop better ways for robots to work together. On top of that, I’ve collaborated on projects that integrate code with hardware, using tools like Arduino, microcontrollers, and sensors to build functional products.

Outside of tech, I love staying active by working out, thrifting for unique finds, trying new foods, and exploring different places. But what really drives me is the opportunity to create things that can have a real-world impact and working with others to help make it happen. That’s where my true passion lies.
